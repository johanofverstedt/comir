Run the following command
First specifying which GPU-devices should be visible: CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 (if you use GPU 0)
The first two paths given as parameters to the script train_comir.py are:
data path of training set of modality A
data path of training set of modality B
Then the next two paths are
data path of validation set of modality A
data path of validation set of modality B

Key parameters in the script are:
logTransformA - Sets if a log transformation of the input images of mod A is performed (useful for some applications)
logTransformB - Sets if a log transformation of the input images of mod B is performed (useful for some applications)

tau - The temperature of the contrastive loss function. High tau typically gives more binary representations,
      and low tau gives more nuanced representations (somewhat simplified).

sim_func - The choice of critic. The default should be 'MSE' according to previous studies.

act_l1/act_l2 - Activation decay (regularization)

equivariance - To apply the rotational equivariance trick

patch_sz - The size of the patches to train on

Example:
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 train_comir.py /.../TrainSet/SHG /.../TrainSet/BF /.../ValidationSet/SHG /.../ValidationSet/BF
